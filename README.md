## About

My background spans data analysis, statistical modeling, machine learning, and business analytics.  
I’ve worked on projects across healthcare, marketing, consumer behavior, econometrics, and product analytics, using tools such as Python, SQL, R, Tableau, and cloud data platforms.

I’m particularly interested in how data translates into decisions, products, and measurable impact.
